Introduction

Do you know the Triangle Inequality Theorem?  Just in case you don’t, here it is:

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.

That sounds easy enough, right?  Your job is to write a program that can identify valid triangles.  Not only do you need to determine if the three sides can form a triangle – you also have to tell what type it is.  There are three classifications of triangles:

Equilateral triangles have three sides of equal length.
Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length and one side that is different.
Scalene triangles have no equal side lengths.
