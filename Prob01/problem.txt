Introduction

Are you tired of traditional game boards like checker boards or chess boards?  Us too!  We would like to invent a game that is played on a board where every square is the same, and we need your help to construct the game board.  Youâ€™ll need to write a program to help you, of course.

# # # # #
# # # # #
# # # # #
