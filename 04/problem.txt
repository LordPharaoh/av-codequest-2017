Introduction

An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once.  For example, the word STOP can be rearranged into the words TOPS and POTS.  An individual who creates anagrams is called an “anagrammatist.”

You have been hired by Anagrammy to create an anagram checker program that they can use to determine whether words submitted by their users are anagrams or not for the purposes of determining a monthly contest winner.  Anagrammy only wants to check word anagrams in their anagram checker and not deal with phrases for their first release.  Anagrammy needs your help in order to officially release their web site.
